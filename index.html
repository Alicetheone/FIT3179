<p>From the world map of the count of countries have hosted Olympic games during the the year from 1960-2020 above,
  we could notice that although the Olympics have been held every 2 year, the host countries only varies between

      <h2>Brodcast Revenue of Hosting Olympics</h2>
      <p>As we can see from the chart on the right side, the broadcase revenue a host country can earn out of Summer 
        Olympics Games is generally more than a host country could earn from hosting a Winter Olympic games. 
        We could even notice some of the broadcast revenue of the previous around of Winter Olympics is only half of the 
        boradcast revenue of the summer Olympics Games. </p>
